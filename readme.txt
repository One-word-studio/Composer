1. Game Instructions
Basic Controls:
Move: Arrow Keys
Interact: E
Select Inventory Slot: 1, 2
Pause Menu: Esc
Objective – Escape the House:
You are a student trapped in a haunted composer’s house. Explore different rooms, solve puzzles, collect items, and find your way out before encountering the composer. Each item you collect will help you move closer to unlocking the escape route.
Inventory System:
You have 2 inventory slots, always visible at the bottom of the screen. Select items using keys 1 and 2. Use items to interact with objects in the house. Choose wisely — not every item will help you immediately.
Puzzle Solving:
The game features puzzles that involve:
Matching tones played
Reconstructing broken visual patterns
Decoding short cryptic notes
Solving puzzles opens new rooms or reveals crucial items needed for the final escape.
Composer Threat:
The composer randomly patrols parts of the house. If he catches you, the game resets to your most recent checkpoint. Watch and listen carefully — his presence is often announced by footsteps or whispering.

2. Game Walkthrough
Game Start:
You begin in the bottom-left room of the house. The main entrance locks behind you, and you must begin your search for clues.
Progression Flow:
Explore the house room by room. Use collected items to unlock access to new rooms. Some examples of item progression:
Use a rusty key to unlock the reading room
A sheet of music placed on a stand reveals a wall safe combination
A mirror shard reflects light to reveal a code
Your goal is to collect the final items required to trigger the escape mechanism in the main foyer.
Final Escape:
Once you’ve gathered all required objects, return to the foyer. Interact with the grand piano and play keys in a specific sequence to activate the exit. Escape before the composer appears — or risk being caught in the final seconds.
